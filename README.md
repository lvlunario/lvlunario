## 📚 Always Learning

Keeping my PMP current and chasing curiosity through every rabbit hole from quantum mechanics to API architecture.  
Because if you're not learning, you're probably just scrolling.

## 💡 Life Outside the Code

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Man:** – One amazing wife, three kids, and a daily reminder that chaos is nature’s way of saying “You’re not in control.” 

🏃‍♂️ **Active lifestyle:** Rowerg, running, weight-lifting, hiking, and failing to dunk since 2003

🛸 **Passions:** 3D printing, flying drones, sourdough and learning stuff nobody asked me to do

🧠 **Motto:** _Ostinato rigore_ (“persistent rigor”)  

🎤 **Quote (George Carlin):** 
> *“The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept.”*
